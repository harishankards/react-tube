# React-tube

This is just a simple React.js app which fetches the required youtube videos from a channel you want. The app is created using create-react-app.
In case you still wanna see the demo of this little creepy app, here you go:
```
git clone "https://github.com/harishankards/react-tube"
cd react-tube/
npm start ```

Now go check here: `localost:3000`
